# Oxygen XML Framework for the Abaev Dictionary Project

This is a custom [Oxygen XML](https://www.oxygenxml.com/) framework for the [TEI](https://tei-c.org/) edition of V.I. Abaev's Historical-Etymological Dictionary of Ossetic.

It is based on Oxygen's official TEI P5 [framework](https://github.com/TEIC/oxygen-tei).

This repository includes a derivative (extracted Cyrillic subset) of the [Comfortaa](https://www.deviantart.com/aajohan/art/Comfortaa-font-105395949) font designed by Johan Aakerlund
and distributed under the [Open Font License](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL).
